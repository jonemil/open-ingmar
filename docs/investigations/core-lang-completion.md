# Core language coverage review

Reviewed 2026-10-21 against source/IR contracts, declaration/executable code,
retained language-guide articles, and Garmin's public API. This review adds no
simulator evidence; SDK 9.2.0 / `fr265` remains the runtime reference environment.
The [prioritized checklist][inventory] owns remaining work.

## Public Lang inventory

**Officially documented:** the [Lang index][lang] lists 24 classes, the
Comparable/Comparator interfaces, Numeric/Integer/Decimal aliases,
NumberFormat/Endian constants, and `format`.

Own-method summaries for all non-exception classes were compared with
`api::core()`, native-call profiles, and frontend contracts. Implemented scalar
methods, Array sorting, source/self Method binding, ByteArray operations, and
`format` must not be relisted as wholly missing. Their supported domains are
specified in the [frontend reference][source]. New type/storage domains need
explicit work only where a concrete unsupported path is identified.

ResourceId's own member is `toString`. Method additionally declares the
`initialize(aClass, aMethod)` constructor. Exception declares `initialize`,
`getErrorMessage`, and `printStackTrace`. Each of the eight Lang exception
subclasses declares a constructor: seven take a String message;
UnexpectedTypeException also takes two Object-or-Null compatibility arguments.
These names and signatures were checked against their linked API pages via the
Lang index. Inherited Object/Exception members need not be duplicated per class
in the worklist. Public API signatures alone do not establish VM bindings or
runtime acceptance.

Downloaded public class pages and extracted own-member names are retained under
`scratch/core-plan-review/`. The compiler/SDK executables were not inspected.

## Language coverage

The official reference/functions, Objects and Memory, Monkey Types,
annotations, and exception-guide snapshots under
`scratch/official-docs/plan-review/` supplied the language coverage map.
The [reading map][reading] retains article links and attribution. Current source
contracts, parser, call/type validation, and format documentation distinguish
implemented forms from remaining items in the
[language checklist](../plan.md#core-language-worklist).

The VM `throw` opcode and ordinary EXCEPTIONS parsing/writing already exist;
source exception IR, handler-range generation, and unwinding semantics do not.
Likewise, implemented `for` loops, parameter assignment, and Object default
initializers are absent from the remaining-work list. An SDK-rejected form is a
documented restriction, not a perpetually unfinished implementation task.

An authored compiler probe (`scratch/core-plan-review/interface-fact.mc`)
confirms that a Comparable parameter refined with `instanceof Token` already
retains Token member calls and can be forwarded to a Comparable consumer.
That source-identity task is not missing. The initial `interface-native.mc`
probe exposed rejection of `c + 1` after a Comparable parameter tested positive
for Number. The [grouped refinement experiment](compiler-comparators.md#native-comparable-refinement)
records its resolution across the scalar Comparable implementations.
